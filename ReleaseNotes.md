* Test non-dependant links not soft deleted
* Documentation

## 1.0.0

### Other things


* Think about using SQL code to improve cascade soft delete performance (very hard)

### Possible improvements

- Change so that it works with navigational properties, backing fields and shadow properties (easy, but needs lots of unit tests)
